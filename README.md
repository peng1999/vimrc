# vimrc
My vimrc

## Installation
[peng1999/config][config] is recommended to install this vimrc.

## Note
1. This vimrc reads a `plugin.vim` file in the 2nd user vimrc directory, if exists, so you can manage your plugins in a separate file.
2. Create directory `~/tmp/vimundo` and `~/tmp/vimbackup` and vim will put undofiles and backups there. `./setup` script in [peng1999/config][config] will do that for you.
